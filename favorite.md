I loved working with nano.  I felt that this text editor worked well with my personal style and I liked
how easy it was to learn.  With Vi, I felt that some of the keys were a little difficult to get and emacs just was not as intuitive as nano turned our to be.
I feel that, moving forward, I will probably stick with nano.
